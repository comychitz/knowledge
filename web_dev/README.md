### browser engine
* a browser engine is the main component of a browser - it is not a stand alone program
* its main job is to take HTML and resource (ex. images) and transform them to a visual representation
* components
   * browser engine = layout engine + rendering engine
   * in theory the layout engine and rendering engine can be separate, but in practice they are tightly coupled
* a browser engine works together with the javascript engine, sharing the DOM

### javascript
* see javascript notes in this repo for more about the language itself
* one of the four languages recommended by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to run natively in browsers (HTML, CSS, and WebAssembly are the others)
* in websites, JS is used to provide interactivity, for example by performing:
   * DOM manipulation
   * fetching data
   * interactive responses to user input
