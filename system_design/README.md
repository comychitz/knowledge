# system design

Let's talk about how different types of systems can be designed, along with
techniques and technologies used to build them.

## general notes
* VPS vs Web-Hosting
* Vertical Scaling
    * Add more/faster/state-of-the-art hardware
    * Bounded by single-machine constraints
* Horizontal Scaling
    * Distribute between many different slower machines
* Load Balancing
    * all servers do the same 
    * each server has a dedicated responsibility
    * round robin
    * can be software or hardware
    * active vs passive load balancer roles
* Caching
    * memcached
    * Redis
* Replication
    * Master - Slave(s) setup
    * Master - Master setup, each master has their own slave(s)
    * With master slave replication all writes are done on the master and all
        reads can be done from the slave(s).
* Database partitioning
    * Horizontal partitioning - put different rows into different tables.
        database shards are horizontal partitions of data. each of multiple
        shards is held on a separate database server to help load balance. like
        vertical partitioning is to normalization, database sharding is to
        horizontal partitioning - it goes further than just horizontal
        partitioning by allowing partitions (shards) to be distributed amongst
        multiple servers
        * main disadvantage is the increased complexity in all aspects of
            interaction and maintainability of the database
    * [Wikipedia - Shard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))
    * Vertical partitioning - create tables with fewer columns - similar to
        normalizing approach. but vertional partitioning goes further on
        normalized data. For example, we might store more used vertical
        partitions on a different device, and less used tables in another
        device. 
* ACID database transactions
    * atomicity
    * consistency
    * isolation
    * durability

## relational vs non-relational database
* relational database use cases
    * when the data your storing is clearly structured and defined - and also
        has the tendency not to change
    * requires up-front investment to figure out how the data is going to be
        stored in the db
    * they are safer, supporting the ACID requirements
    * more popular and standardized - everyone knows SQL
    * responds well to vertical scaling - not horizontal (though some now
        support it, but it is a complex thing to setup in comparison to
        non-relational dbs)
* non-relational database use cases
    * data format/definition is constantly changing
    * scalability is a hard requirement - non-relational databases support
        horizontal scaling and sharding much better
    * stale reads are a problem in non-relational dbs
* non-relational database types
    * column-oriented
    * document-oriented
    * key-value
    * graph
