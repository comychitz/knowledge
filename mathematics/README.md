## why log?
Why is the *logarithm* function so important and frequently used in engineering?
Well, there are many answers to that question, but let's try and breakdown why
*log* is so powerful and also show some practical applications of it.

*log* is the inverse function to exponentiation. In other words, taking the
logarithm of a value `x` results in the exponent that is required to apply to
the base of the logarithm to result with x.
```
logb(x) = y  b^y = x
```

Logarithms have many applications in science and engineering. Logarithms were
first introduced by John Napier in the 1700s to offer the ability to more easily
perform computations using slide rules and log tables. However, the modern day
notion of logarithms stems from Leonhard Euler's discovery linking them to
exponential function.

Logarithmic scales and graphs are often used when data sets need to be visually
presented, especially when the data covers a large range of values or contain
exponential laws or power laws (these will show up as straight lines). This is
helpful when viewing the data as it allows readers to see trends that aren't
visible when viewing on a linear scale.
