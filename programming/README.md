# programming essentials

## general notes
* idempotence: the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application [idempotence - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
* 

## remember to always...
* optimize for reader not the writer(!)
* be consistent(!)
* keep it simple, stupid(!)
* if unit testing is difficult, revisit your design/implementation


## design patterns
* observer (aka listener) pattern
  * the subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them (via calling one their methods) of state changes. this is common in event-driven programming.
