# programming essentials

## remember to always...
* optimize for reader not the writer(!)
* be consistent(!)
* keep it simple, stupid(!)
* if unit testing is difficult, revisit your design/implementation


## design patterns
* observer (aka listener) pattern
  * the subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them (via calling one their methods) of state changes. this is common in event-driven programming.
