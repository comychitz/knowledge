  * What is computer memory?
    - Typically, computer memory refers to the devices that is a computer's "primary storage" device (non-volative). A computer uses memory for holding information about it's current tasks/jobs, thus access, ideally, should be quick and inexpensive.
  * Flash Memory
    - [wikiArticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) - "is an electronic (solid-state) non-volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed."
  * SRAM
    * uses 4 to 6 transistors per bit
    * very fast & expensive,
    * often used as CPU cache
  * DRAM
   * dynamic, needs refreshing
   * one capacitor & one transistor per bit (high density)
