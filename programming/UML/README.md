# Unified Modeling Language
Use UML to track relationships between classes and show inheritance heirarchies.

## Symbol Definitions
* Represent classes with rectangles
* Use angle brackets with the word "abstract" or "interface" to indicate either an abstract class or interface
* Show the is-a relationship between classes with an open up-arrow
* Show the is-a relationship that involves an interface with an open, dotted up-arrow
* Show the has-a relationship with a down arrow or sideways arrow (indicates composition)
