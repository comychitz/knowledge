# javascript
Some notes about the "language of the Internet".

## general notes
* javascript is a multi-paradigm language
    * paradigms: object-oriented (prototype-based), imperative, functional
    * dynamic and weakly typed
    * type system: dynamic, duck
    * interpreted language
* created by Mozilla
* it was named javascript because of the populate lingo "java" - but has
    nothing to do with Java.
    * standardized as ECMAScript
* initially implemented for client-side browsing, but now it has expanded to be
    used in many other ways:
    * mobile applications
    * server-side apps
    * non-web programs like word processor and PDF software
* javascript is used alongside CSS and HTML to create webpages/web apps
* it relies on a run-time environment to provide interface to the environment it
    is running in (this is typically your browser)
* JSON = JavaScript *Object* Notation
* functions are first-class in JS

### the event loop
* [How The Javascript Event Loop Works](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-event-loop-and-the-rise-of-async-programming-5-ways-to-better-coding-with-2f077c4438b5)
  * "The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it."

### functional programming in javascript
* main concepts of functional programming:
    * pure functions
    * function composition
    * avoid shared state
    * avoid mutating state
    * no side-effects
* map, filter & reduce

## videos & examples
### Example 1 - Build a Bookmarker Application in Javascript
This example goes through how to build a web application that saves bookmarks
for you. It uses [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to quickly get up and
running with a theme for your web page. It then sets up a basic HTML page and
builds javascript to interact with the user and use HTML local storage APIs
(which is part of the HTML basic language) to store some basic data.
