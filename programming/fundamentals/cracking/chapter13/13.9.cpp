/**
 * Question 
 *
 * Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory
 * such that the memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of
 * two. 
 * EXAMPLE
 * align_mall(1000,128) will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128
 * and that pointers to memory of size 1000 bytes.
 * aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.
