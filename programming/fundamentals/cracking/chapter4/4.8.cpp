 * Question 
 *
 * you have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2,
 * with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of
 * T1. 
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the
 * subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n,
 * the two trees would be identical.
