 * Question 
 *
 * Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot
 * can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are
 * there for the robot to go from (0,0) to (X,Y)?
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Imagine certain spots are "off limits", such that the robot cannot step on
 * them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to
 * the bottom right.
