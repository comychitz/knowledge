/**
 * Question 
 *
 * Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and
 * block on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its oppnonents on both the
 * left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured
 * and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture at least one of your
 * oppenent's pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves.
 * The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement the
 * object-oriend design for Othello.
