/**
 * There are three ants on different verticies of a trianlge. What is the
 * probability of collision (between any to or all of themk) if they start
 * walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a
 * direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that
 * they walk at the same speed. 
 * Similarly, find the probablility of collision with n ants on an n-vertex
 * polygon.
