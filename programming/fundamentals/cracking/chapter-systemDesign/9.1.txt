Stock Data: Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by
up to 1,000 client applications to get simple end-of-day stock price information
(open, close, high, low). You may assume that you already have the data, and you
can store it in any format you wish. How would you design the client-facing
service that provides the information to client applications? You are respon-
sible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would
recommend your approach.Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can
distribute the information to the client applications in any mechanism you
choose.

Scoping the problem:
- clients are requesting by the stock/company's name?

Characteristics of this problem:
- read-heavy
- 

Basic components:
- client app interface (web interface)
- calls to back end to retrieve info on per-stock basis
    - i.e. send request of all stocks the user is watching,
      then return the info for those stocks
- database to store historical data
    - need redundancy support
    - can be sql because the data is pretty structured given our requirements
- use a cache to speed up reading
