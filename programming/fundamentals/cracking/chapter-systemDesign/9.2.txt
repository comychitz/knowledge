Social Network: How would you design the data structures for a very large social
network like Facebook or Linkedln? Describe how you would design an algorithm
to show the shortest path between two people (e.g., Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason
-> You).

- Use a graph(!)
    - no weights on edges
    - an edge in the graph means a direct connection between two users
    - doing breadth first search will find shortest path between two nodes
        - can do bidirectional search as well
- can't keep the whole thing in memory, but maybe load up to a certain, depth,
  then as traversing can load/unload more as needed(?)
