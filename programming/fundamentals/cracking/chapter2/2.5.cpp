/**
 * Question 
 *
 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a
 * single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit
 * is at the head of the list. Write a functino that adds the two numbers and
 * returns the sum as a linked list. 
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: (7->1->6) + (5->9->2). This is, 617+295
 * Output: 2->1->9. That is, 912.
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
