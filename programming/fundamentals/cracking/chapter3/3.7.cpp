/**
 * Question 
 *
 * An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operations on a stricly
 * "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on
 * arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they
 * would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that
 * type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the
 * data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as
 * enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in
 * LinkedList data structure.
