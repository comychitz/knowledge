/**
 * Question 
 *
 * In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you hae 3 towers and N disks
 * of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with
 * disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk
 * sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
 * 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
 * 3) A disk can only be placed on top of a lerger disk.
 * Write a program to mvoe the disks from the first toer to the last using
 * stacks.
