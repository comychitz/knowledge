 * Question 
 *
 * Suppose we have the following code:
 * public class Foo {
 *  public Foo() { ... }
 *  public void first() { ... }
 *  public void second() { ... }
 *  public void thid() { ... }
 * }
 *
 * The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. ThreadA
 * will call first, threadB will call second, and threadC will call third.
 * Design a mechanism to ensure that first is callbed before second and second
 * is called before third.
