/**
 * Question 
 *
 * Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next
 * to each other.
 *
 * Example:
 * input =  ["tar", "car", "rat", "race", "care"]
 * output = ["car", "care", "race", "tar", "rat"]
 *
 * Definition:
 * - anagrams are when words contain the same letter distribution
 *
 * Approach:
 * - can sort each string, then sort on that
 * - can creat a map of sorted string to list of strings
 *   - each sort would be nlog(n) and each insert would be log(n)
