# javascript
Some notes about the "language of the Internet". 

## general notes
* javascript is a multi-paradigm language
    * paradigms: object-oriented (prototype-based), imperative, functional
    * dynamic and weakly typed
    * type system: dynamic, duck
    * interpreted language
* created by Mozilla
* it was named javascript because of the populate lingo "java" - but has
    nothing to do with Java.
        * standardized as ECMAScript
* initially implemented for cleint-side browsing, but now it has expanded to be
    used in many other ways:
        * mobile applications
        * server-side apps
        * non-web programs like word processor and PDF software
* javascript is used alongside CSS and HTML to create webpages/web apps
* it relies on a run-time environment to provide interface to the environment it
    is running in (this is typically your browser)
* JSON = JavaScript *Object* Notation
* functions are first-class in JS

### functional programming in javascript
* main concepts of functional programming:
    * pure functions
    * function composition
    * avoid shared state
    * avoid mutating state
    * no side-effects
* map, filter & reduce

### Example 1 - Build a Bookmarker Appliction in Javascript
This example goes through how to build a web application that saves bookmarks
for you. It uses [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to quickly get up and
running with a theme for your web page. It then sets up a basic HTML page and
builds javascript to interact with the user and use HTML local storage APIs
(which is part of the HTML basic language) to store some basic data.
