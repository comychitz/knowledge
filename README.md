# Knowledge
This repository contains notes (mostly about computer science/engineering) that I have consolidated from my classes in school, personal projects, & work. It mainly serves as a personal reference for myself, but others are welcome to read all the nonsense :)

## Topics
A list of some topics you will find in this repository:
  * networking
  * databases
  * programming languages
  * vim
  * emacs
  * and more!
  
## Sources
School notes are from my undergraduate studies from the Computer Engineering program at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the Computer Science Masters program at the University of California, Irvine. Outside of academia, I compile whatever I learned from books, online, projects or work.
