# productivity
In life, being productive is a good thing, it increases the meaning of your life
and helps achieve new heights you can never imagine. 

# deep work
Deep work is a self-help book written by Cal Newport. It discusses a concept of
productivity known as *deep work*. He explains that today's society is full of
distractions - due to the Internet, social media, and other advances - and deep
work is becoming increasingly uncommon, yet the demand is needed. The book
discusses what deep work is, why it is important, and how anyone is able to
integrate deep work into his/her life.

## Deep Work - Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted Worl
### Introduction
* Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
    concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to theri limit. These
    efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
* Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often
    performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not crete much new value
    in the world and are easy to replicate.
* The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep with is becoming
    increasingly rare at the exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly
    valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill,
    and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
### Part 1: The idea
* Deep Work is Valuable
    * Two core abilities for thriving in the New Economy
        * The ability to quickly master hard things
        * The ability to produce at an elite leve, in terms of both quality and
            speed
        * Both of these require the ability to perform deep work
    * High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spec) x (Intensity of Focus)
* Deep Work is Rare
    * The Metric Black Hole
    * The Principle of Least Resistance
        * In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various
            behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that
            easiest in the moment.
    * Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
        * In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive
            and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward
            an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a
            visible manner
    * The Cult of the Internet
    * Bad for Business. Good for You.
* Deep Work is Meaningful
    * A Neurological Argument for Depth
        * Our brains construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.
        * Shallow workdays will result in a drained and upsetting day.
        * Increasing the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the
            complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several
            neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisftaction you'll
            associate with your working life.
    * A Psychological Argument for Depth
        * the best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is
            strecthed to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish
            something difficult and worthwhile 
        * Human beings are at their best when immersed deeply in something
            challenging.
