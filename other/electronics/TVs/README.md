# Televisions
Some notes on TVs and how they work, differences between types, etc.

## General Notes
* difference between LCD and LED is the way the liquid crystals are lit from the back.
* they call it a LCD when the liquid crystals are lighted from the back with CCFLs (cold cathode fluorescent lamps).
* they call it LED when the LCD is back lit with LEDs. it's sometimes called LED-LCD too
* LCD is cheaper. and plasma is cheapest(I think)

#### 1080p vs 1080i
* p = progress scan 
  * scans every row of pixel progressively, harder to pull off and results in better images. especially in faster motion scenes.
* i = interlaced scan 
  * images are display by illuminating odd and even pixel dos in an alternating fashion. you need a tv bigger than 42 inches to realize the difference
