## money master the game - tony robbins
The best-selling book by Tony Robbins is a great resource for the average
investor. He takes difficult topics and makes them easy for readers to
understand. In essence, he is "doing the right thing" by sharing what some of
top investors in the world have done and what they believe is the right way to
approaching investing. 
I enjoyed reading the book, but also felt conflicted sometimes when reading the
book because it seems like Tony is giving reader a simple "quick fix" for
getting rich. This is my own interpretation, may not be his intention. There was
a lot of value in reading this book, and some of the points I thought were
interesting I made sure to write down.
