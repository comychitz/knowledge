#Wine
So when I was in undergrad, I had the pleasure of taking a class that covered wine, beers & spirits, but mostly covered wine. It was very informative and I genuinely enjoyed it. I took a separate class just about beer during the same quarter, to ensure my beer knowledge was up to par as well. It was senior year ;)

##General Notes
Warning: these notes are sporadic
* gold color means it was most likely in an oak barrel
* fruit smell is deeper in the glass
* flower spell is more on the outer of the to of the glass
* acid in wine is a positive thing
  * gives it crispness, makes it good with food
* we taste sweet/dry, we smeel fruity
* wine rarely has salt, pretty much never
* white wine is usually described with fruityness/acidity
* more alcohol more viscosity(!)
* chess is pairde with wine because they both have lactic acid
* usa is the only country where wine consumption is increasing
* the feeling of tannins makes your mouth dry (only in red wine)
* dry means how much sugar is left in the wine
* white wine grapes
  * chardonney, sauvignon blanc, riesling, chenin blanc, viognier, pinot gris/grigio
* red wine grapes
  * cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, cabernet franc, sangiouese, tempranillo, syrah/shiraz, granch/garnacha, zinfandel, gamay, malbec
* pretigious hierarchy of wine 
    * vin de table -> vin de pays -> VDQS -> AOC
    * VDQS = "wanna be quality wines"
    * AOC = Appellation d'Origin Controllee
 * color difference at the rim shows age. the lighter the rime the older the wine
 * swirling, then if tears dope slow means a lot of sugar or alcohol
 * red wine smells -> citrus, tree-fruit, tropical fruit
 * 5 tasts : sweet, sour, bitter, salty & umami/savory
 * Sauvignon blan is a versatile wine, does grow well in many places
 * 1 hour in fridge for red wine, 2 hours for white wine, 3 hours sparkling
 * if you don't know what to serve, server champagne
  * refreshing on palette, refreshes taste each bite
* old world vs new world wines
  * new world - newer countries producing wine (US, Australia, New Zealand, etc.)
   * these new wines are typically more fruity
   * fermentation in stainless steel vs barrels
* if fruity smells is the frist smells that you get, it's usually a new world wine. if struggling to smell fruit, then its probably an old world wine
* making red wine involves three more steps than white wine
* brix - the sugar content in an aqueous solution
  * ex. one degree brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution
* cycle of growing grapes 
  * dormancy
  * bud break
  * flowering & fruit set
  * grape growth
  * verasion
  * green harvest
  * final ripening
  * harvest
* ph is the measure of the concentration of acidity
* methods of cooking with wine: roating, baking, boiling, frying, smoking
* chardonney is an expensive grape; it's often blended
* acidic wines balance out richness, fattiness & saltiness of lots of foods
* high alcohol wines work better with rich or high-fat foods & sauces
* tannic wines work well with grilled food, especially high fat red meat
* chardonney
  * non-aromic, versatil wine, neutral
  * does best in cool like climates
  * good for the beginner
  * expensive, usually blended
  * influenced in the winery
  * pale yellow (steel aging) or deeper yellow (aged in wood)
* sauvignon blanc
  * opposite of chardonney, "cries for food"
  * influence in the vineyard
  * does best in cool climates
  * need well drained soil
  * colorless to pale yellm hint of green
* reisling
  * high acidity, can be sweet to dry
  * not aged in barrel or vessel
  * rarely blended
  * can be late harvested
  * best in cool climates
  * can resist brutal winters because of thick base
  * same color as pale to light yellow, minor green
* chenin blanc
  * high acidity, sparkling wines, usually blended
  * commonly called "pineau de la lovre"
  * difficult to grow: buds early & ripens late
  * high acidity makes it good for sweet or sparkling wine
* muscat
  * may be the parent of all vinifera varieties
  * considered to be first grape made into wine
* pinot gris/pinot grigio
  * mutation of pinot noir
  * grapes are red wine is white, unless skin not removes before fermentation
* pinot blanc
  * lacks distinctive aromas & flavors, but has acidity & body
  * pinot blanc is mutation of pinto gris
  * typically blended w/Auxeprois for dry, rich-style
* semillon
  * highly regarded in Bordeaux
  * yellow-gold grape - easy to grow
  * mostly blended
* viognier
  * warm climate grape
  * difficult to grow: ripes easily, low in acidity
  * dark color, aromas of stone fruit and flowers
  * body from long-ripening & high potential alcohol
* nebbiolo 
  * "the kind of wines and the wines of kinds"
  * crazy acidity - can be very painful (some describe it as knives cutting your mouth)
  * someimtes can take 30 to 40 years to mature
* making wine
  * white
    * grape receiving
    * crushing & destemming
    * pressing
    * fermentation
    * aging
    * racking
    * blending
    * stabilization & clarification
    * bottling
  * red
    * grape receiving
    * crushing & destemming
    * cold soak
    * fermentation
    * maceration
    * pressing
    * MLF
    * aging
    * racking
    * blending
    * stabilization & clarification
    * bottling
  * white wine fermentation 
    * several days to several weeks
      * because fermentation happens at a lower temperature
  * red wine fermentation
    * 5-10 days
  * oxygen enhances wine's flavors, softens tannins, and stabilizes color
  * MLF reduces acidity in wine
  * stabilization is a process primarily used to remove protein, yeast & bacteria
    * proteins and yeast can cause cloudiness
  * cold stabilization prevents tartaric crystals
  * clarification = fining & filtration
  * corked wine = wine cork got infected w/TCA
    * ruins wine with musty smell and of aromas. covers up the fruitiness
  * fruity smells - corked wine, brett (yeast infection), oxidation, acetic acid, acetacoehyde, ethyl acetate, excessive, sulfur dioxide, hygrogen sulfide & mercaptan (rotten egg smell)
  * faulty tastes - excessive bitterness & metallic taste
