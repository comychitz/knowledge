#Wine
So when I was in undergrad, I had the pleasure of taking a class that covered wine, beers & spirits, but mostly covered wine. It was very informative and I genuinely enjoyed it. I took a separate class just about beer during the same quarter, to ensure my beer knowledge was up to par as well. It was senior year ;)
