# Crypto Currencies
Crypto currency (and related topics) notes.

## General Notes & Concepts
* By definition, a crytographic currency (cyrpto currency) is a digital asset that
    uses cyrptography to secure transactions. There are many examples, the most
    prominent of all being Bitcoin. 
* The heart of many crypto currencies such as Bitcoin is consensus - there must
    be an agreed upon method which the nodes on the network can safely, securely
    and quickly agree upon changes in the state of the system.
* The goal of Bitcoin is to provide a decentralized system upon which exchanges 
    of value can occur without a trusted authority or central server, while 
    protecting against the double spending problemn. 
* Coins are based on digital signatures, which like a person's signature, offers
    non-repudiation, authentication, and integrity. 
* The Blockchain 
    * a chain of records (blocks) secured using cryptographic functions to
      serve a public (or private) [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger)
    * a blockchain is maintained by a network of communicating nodes (aka a
      peer-to-peer network)
    * a blockchain is a distributed database; each node has a copy of it
    * the longest blockchain is the "true" blockchain in a network
    * "Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed
      computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance."
    * the time it takes for an attacker to undo previous blocks and catch up
      expontentially decreases as more transactions are computed
    * Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualized (2008) the first distributed blockchain
      to serve as a [distributed] public ledger (Bitcoin)
* Mining
    * using cpu processing power, a node/computer will help "keep the blockhain
      consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and
      collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions
      called a block" [wikiArticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining)
    * "To be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a
      so-called proof-of-work."
* Proof-of-Work system
    * wikipedia: is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and
      other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from
      the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.
    * challenge-response vs solution-verification protocols
    * ideally, verification at the provider (server) should be quick as possible
    * proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake vs proof-of
* [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)
    * first coined in 1996 by Nick Szabo
    * "A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form,
      including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises."
    * A smart contract is "a computerized transaction protocol that executes the
      terms of a contract."
    * A blockchain-based smart contract is visible to all. Meaning all
      bugs/flaws/vulnerabilities can be seen, which is bad if not fixed quickly
    * Decentralized cryptocurrency protocols are smart contracts with
      decentralized security, encryption, and limited trusted parties that fit
      Szabo's definition of a digital agreement with observability,
      verifiability, privity, and enforceability
* Ethereum
    * (read white & yellow papers for full details; links below)
    * so much more to offer than Bitcoin does; Bitcoin is designed and aimed for
        purely exchanges of goods/value, whereas Ethereum is a network upon which
        any type of transaction can occur
    * "one key goal is to facilitate transactions between consenting
      individuals who would otherwise have no means to trust one another"
    * "Early work on smart contracts has been done by Szabo [1997] and Miller
        [1997]. Around the 1990s it became clear that algorithmic enforcement of
        agreements could become a significant force in human cooperation"
    * "The ethereum white paper splits dapps into three types: apps that manage
        money, apps where money is involved (but also requires another piece),
        and apps in the “other” category, which includes voting and governance
        systems."
* Decentralized Applications (dapps)
    * software applications can be thought of as three classes:
      1) centralized 2) decentralied 3) distributed

### Terminology & Related Topics
* coins vs altcoins vs tokens
    * altcoins - general term for cryptocurrencies, both those that were
      Bitcoin-Derived blockchains (litecoin, namecoin) or have their own native 
      blockchain (ethereum, ripple, etc.)
    * in general, "coins" is a synonym for "altcoins" 
    * tokens - Tokens are a representation of a particular asset or utility,
      that usually resides on top of another blockchain
        * tokens are built using smart contracts
    * The main difference between altcoins and tokens is in their structure;
      altcoins are separate currencies with their own separate blockchain while
      tokens operate on top of a blockchain that facilitates the creation of
      decentralized applications.
    * ICOs - Initial Coin Offerings are actually token offerings to the public
* white paper vs yellow paper
    * white paper is higher level, less techy
    * yellow paper is like a research level paper, has all the details, etc.
      typically these do not have authorised value
* client software
    * client software != mining software
    * for example, ethereum client software is light-weight interaction with the
        network - meaning interacting with contracts, performing transactions,
        transfering funds, etc. 

### Fun Facts
* supply is limited(!)
    * there will be only 21 million bitcoins supplied (by desgin)
    * approx. 12.5 bitcoins per blocks until 2020, then halving every four years
      until no more are distributed, which should be between years 2110-40
