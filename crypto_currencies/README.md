Crypto currency-related notes, for example, on Bitcoin, Ethereum, how it works, etc. - all that jazz.

## General Notes
* The goal of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies [in general] is to provide a
  decentralized network upon with exchanges of goods and services can occur
  without a single authority controlling the network.
* Crypto currency - a digitcal asset that uses cryptography to secure
  transactions
* double-spending problem
    * the fundamental problem of any currency, which Bitcoin become to be the 
    first digital asset that protected against double-spending
* The basis of coins are digital signatures
    * Signatures offer non-repudiation, authentication, and integrity.
* blockchain
    * a chain of records (blocks) secured using cryptographic functions
    * Satoishi Nakamoto conceptualized (2008) the first distributed blockchain
      to serve as a public ledger
    * the longest blockchain is the "true" blockchain in a network
    * the time it takes for an attacker to undo previous blocks and catch up
      expontentially decreases as more transactions are computed
* proof-of-work system
    * wikipedia:  is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and
      other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from
      the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.
    * challenge-response vs solution-verification protocols
    * ideally, verification at the provider (server) should be quick as possible
* Coins vs Tokens
    * ??
