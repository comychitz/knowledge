# Cryto 
Crypto currency-related notes, for example, on Bitcoin, Ethereum, how it works, etc. - all that jazz.

## General Notes
* crypto currency - a digital asset that uses cryptography to secure
  transactions
* The goal of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies [in general] is to provide a
  decentralized system upon which exchanges of goods and services can occur
  without a trusted authority or central server, and protects against the 
  double spending problem.
* the basis of coins are digital signatures
    * signatures offer non-repudiation, authentication, and integrity
* blockchain
    * a chain of records (blocks) secured using cryptographic functions
    * Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualized (2008) the first distributed blockchain
      to serve as a public ledger
    * a blockchain is maintained by a network of communicating nodes 
    * a blockchain is a distributed database; each node has a copy of it
    * the longest blockchain is the "true" blockchain in a network
    * the time it takes for an attacker to undo previous blocks and catch up
      expontentially decreases as more transactions are computed
* mining
    * using cpu processing power, a node/computer will help "keep the blockhain
      consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and
      collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions
      called a block" [wikiArticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining)
    * "To be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a
      so-called proof-of-work."
* proof-of-work system
    * wikipedia:  is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and
      other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from
      the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.
    * challenge-response vs solution-verification protocols
    * ideally, verification at the provider (server) should be quick as possible
* bitcoin supply
    * there will be only 21 million bitcoins supplied
    * approx. 12.5 bitcoins per blocks until 2020, then having every four years
      until no more are distributed, which should be between years 2110-40
* coins vs tokens
    * ??
